Run a Linear Regression on provided data using OLS

Hi Tony!

My program runs from the command line. Make sure codingTest.py and AirPassengers.csv are in the same folder, then navigate to that file and enter:

python codingTest.py AirPassengers.csv

Presto!

Hopefully that worked. Meaning you see a 'Line of Best Fit' of the form Y = M*X + B and a graph displaying a scatter plot of data points and the Line of Best Fit itself.

If your default browser is not an actual web browser (for example, if you open up .html files with an emacs gui or something like that by default) then you will have to go to open the AirPassengersGraph.html file with a browser window in order to see the final graph.

I've also supplied screenshots (per your request) of what is being output on my screen.

Thanks for the chance to apply! ConnectCubed seems like a cool organization and I hope the conversion to Bayesian Linear Regression goes well.

If you have any questions, feel free to email me.
